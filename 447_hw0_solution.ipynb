Because $B$ is a matrix, while $x$ is a vector, and addition between matrices and vectors of any shape is not defined. Should $B+x$ be a vector, or a matrix? Actually, we cannot say without making an (arbitrary) choice!\n","\n","To expand on this point a little further, we want to distinguish $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}$ from $\\mathbb{R}^n$.
